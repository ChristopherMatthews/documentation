<p>Enterprise Organizations can use the same process to assume ownership of a site; however, Agency Partners do not have the ability to own sites directly.</p>
<p>Resellers should contact Pantheon Support directly to transfer ownership.</p>
=======
<p>If a credit card is already associated with the site, site ownership can not be transferred using the Make Owner method above.</p>
<p>Removing a credit card from a Live site will put the site into the offline Sandbox mode.</p>
<p>To temporarily remove the card and enable ownership transfer:</p>
<ol>
 <li>From the Pantheon Site Dashboard, click <strong><span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings</strong>.</li>
 <li>In the <strong>Your Credit Cards</strong> section, change the selected credit card to <strong>Do not bill this site to a card.</strong> and click <strong>Update Payment Method</strong>.
 <li>Continue with the steps below for when there is no credit card associated with the site.</li>
