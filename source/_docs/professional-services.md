TODO: be more verbose, establish a level of conficence... e.g. walk through of process... 6 steps, automation, etc... one or two sentences for each.
* Qualification. access to servers; talk to team about business critical functionality to smoke test it
* Initial migration: automation, "tools that automate moving code/db/file to Pant and standing up..."
* Test and patch: we implement all the thing to ensure that everything is working as expected and building out additional scripting to be able to do pre-launch content syncing
* UAT: test the site yourself, supported by Visual Regression tools; have mechanism to report any issues that are found and work to resolve those issues.
* Launch Planning: work with your team to do launch planning like... content resyncs, etc.
* Launch: Our team stands by during the DNS cutover to handle any potential migration issues and we stick around post-launch... (todo : see pp) 

### Managed Updates
Allow Pantheon’s PS team to apply core and contributed plugins/module updates. Includes visual regression testing (**VRT**) to ensure that no issues arise from the updates.

### Advanced CDN
Implement additional services like extended WAF, Image Optimization, and Domain Masking using our advanced CDN implementation.

## Load Testing
Load and performance tests are critical steps in ensuring a successful launch. There is no better way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before you’ve launched your site. Load tests provide critical insight for how a site will perform in the wild and under peak traffic spikes.

Diamond support plans include load tests, ensuring that your website launches smoothly and is ready to absorb the high traffic that success brings. Expert load tests are also available for Gold and Platinum plans. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/contact-us){.external} for details.

## Pre-launch Load Testing
Load tests are critical steps in ensuring a successful launch. There is no better way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before you’ve launched your site.
